# Interactive Particle Text - "Learn. Share. Repeat."

An interactive P5.js visualization where particles reveal the text "Learn. Share. Repeat." as you hover your mouse over them.

## Features

- Text formed by blue particles that scatter when you hover over them
- Additional red particles that add visual interest to the background
- Particles return to their original positions when not disturbed
- Responsive design that works on any screen size
- Subtle animation effects with particle trails

## How to Use

1. Move your mouse over the particles to scatter them and reveal the text
2. The particles will return to their original positions when you move your mouse away
3. Try clicking and holding to create a stronger repulsion effect

## Implementation Details

- Uses P5.js for rendering and animation
- Text is converted to points using P5's `textToPoints()` function
- Implements steering behaviors for particle movement
- Dynamically adjusts to window resizing
